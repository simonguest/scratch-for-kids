# 2nd Lesson Challenge
### Create a project that combines random numbers, if/then blocks, and broadcasts.
#### Work alone or in pairs, and then show to the rest of the class

## Idea
### When Scratch is clicked, he broadcasts a message to another sprite. The other sprite moves a random number of spaces. If the other sprite is on the edge of the screen, it says "Ouch!"
