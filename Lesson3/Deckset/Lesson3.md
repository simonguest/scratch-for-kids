# Today's Lesson

- Variables
- Using Operators and Conditionals with Variables
- Lists/Arrays
- Lesson 3 Challenge!

--- 

# What's a Variable?

--- 

# x = 4

---

# score = 1000

--- 

# number-of-steps = 39

--- 

# What can variables be used for?

- Keeping score in a game
- Asking for information
- Storing other data

# Using variables in Scratch (asking name)

---

# Using variables in Scratch (counting steps)

---

# Using Operators and Conditionals with Variables

--- 

# Operators are blocks that you can move into any whitespace

---

# Often used with conditional statements (If/then)

---

if (number-of-steps > 100) say "I'm tired!"

---

# Lists/Arrays in Scratch

--- 

# Used to store more than one piece of information

---

# 3rd Lesson Challenge

# 3rd Lesson Challenge
### Create a project that combines variables, if/then blocks, and operators.
#### Work alone or in pairs, and then show to the rest of the class
#### Bonus points for using random numbers, lists and broadcasts

---

## Idea
### Scratch asks you five questions in random order. If you get a question right, you score 10 points. At the end of five questions your score is shown.
